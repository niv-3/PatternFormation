# Pattern Formation: Reaction-Diffusion Simulations

This project simulates reaction-diffusion systems using the **Grey-Scott** model to demonstrate Turing instability. The system generates patterns, such as animal fur patterns, using numerical methods like the **Explicit** and **Crank-Nicolson** methods.
