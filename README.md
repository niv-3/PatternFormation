Pattern Formation: Reaction-Diffusion Simulations
This project simulates reaction-diffusion systems using the Grey-Scott model to demonstrate Turing instability. The system generates patterns, such as animal fur patterns, using numerical methods like the Explicit method and Crank-Nicolson method.

Requirements
This project requires several Python dependencies to run the simulation and generate patterns. You can install them by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
List of dependencies:
numpy: For numerical computations
matplotlib: For visualizing and plotting results
scipy: For scientific computing and numerical integration
dask: For parallel computing
click: For the command-line interface (CLI) tool
Installation
Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine or cloud environment:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/niv-3/PatternFormation.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd PatternFormation
Install the Required Dependencies

Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Optionally Install the Package Globally

If you want to install the package globally so you can run the simulation from anywhere, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install .
Project Structure
The project directory contains the following structure:

bash
Copy code
PatternFormation/
├── pattern_simulation.py       # Main simulation script
├── reaction_diffusion.py       # Code for reaction-diffusion calculations
├── requirements.txt            # List of dependencies
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
└── images/                     # Directory for saving generated images
pattern_simulation.py: The main script that runs the reaction-diffusion simulation.
reaction_diffusion.py: Contains the reaction-diffusion model implementation and helper functions like f(), g(), and finite_difference_step().
requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies for the project.
README.md: Project documentation.
images/: This folder contains images generated by the simulation.
Usage
To run the reaction-diffusion simulation, execute the pattern_simulation.py script:

bash
Copy code
python pattern_simulation.py
The simulation will run for a set number of time steps (Tmax = 500) and generate images showing the system's state at each step. These images will be saved in the images/ directory (e.g., pattern_50.png).

Alternatively, if you installed the package globally, you can run the simulation via the command line:

bash
Copy code
run-simulation
Example Output
After running the simulation, the system will generate images of reaction-diffusion patterns. For example:
